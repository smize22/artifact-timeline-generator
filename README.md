# artifact-timeline-generator
A forensic tool for generating artifact timelines
For this project, I utilized AI as a tool for guidance, spcifically for understanding concepts.  I needed clarification on programming techniques, and AI was able to point out my mistakes. I made sure to implement my own logic and ideas for the entire project.  My goal was to learn and practice Python, as well as the process of developing a toll for forensic investigation.
